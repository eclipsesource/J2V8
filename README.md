J2V8 provides Java bindings for the V8 JavaScript engine. It focuses on performance, tight integration with V8, and a "primitive first" approach to improve efficiency.

It is commonly used in multi-platform mobile toolkits like [tabris.js](https://tabrisjs.com) and is a great choice for executing JavaScript on Android.

## Building J2V8

Building J2V8 requires compiling both the native parts and the Java library (.jar/.aar).  
See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for detailed instructions.
