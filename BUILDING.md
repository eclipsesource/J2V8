# Getting started / building from source

#### Requirements

1. Python 2
2. Docker (*only required for building using Docker)
3. CMake

#### Build

1. clone the source code from the [J2V8 GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/J2V8)
2. run `j2v8-cli.cmd` (on Win32) or `source j2v8-cli.sh` on MacOS / Linux
3. `nodejs git clone` to clone the Node.js/V8 source code
4. `nodejs diff apply` to apply the required modifications to the Node.js source code
5. start the desired J2V8 build either via `build -i` or `build ...args` (see below for details)

```shell
build -h, --help
# or
python build.py -h, --help

usage: build [-h] --target {android,linux,macos,win32} --arch {x86,x64,arm}
             [--vendor VENDOR] [--keep-native-libs] [--node-enabled]
             [--docker] [--vagrant] [--sys-image SYS_IMAGE] [--no-shutdown]
             [--redirect-stdout] [--interactive]
             [build-steps [build-steps ...]]
```

### Basic Examples

Build for Debian/Ubuntu Linux x64 on the host-system:<br/>
`build -t linux -a x64`

Build for Debian/Ubuntu Linux x64 using Docker:<br/>
`build -t linux -a x64 -dkr`

Build for Alpine-Linux x64 using Docker and Node.js features included:<br/>
`build -v alpine -t linux -a x64 -dkr -ne`

Build for MacOSX x64 using Vagrant excluding Node.js features:<br/>
`build -t macos -a x64 -vgr`

Build for Windows x64 directly on the host-system, Node.js features included:<br/>
`build -t win32 -a x64 -ne`

### Build-Step syntax

If no build-steps are specified, then the CLI will run `all` available build-steps by default.
To see a list of available build-steps run `build --help` or see the ***Build-Steps*** section below.

For ease of use, there are also some advanced build-step aliases that when specified will run a collection of some of the base-steps:

- `all` ... is the default, and will run all known build-steps
- `native` ... will run only the build-steps that are relevant for building **native** artifacts
    - `node_js`, `j2v8_cmake`, `j2v8_jni`, `j2v8_cpp`, `j2v8_optimize`
- `j2v8` ... runs all build-steps, except for `nodejs` and `j2v8test`
- `java` ... alias for the single `j2v8java` step
- `test` ... alias for the single `j2v8test` step

#### Anti-Steps
Anti-steps provide a way to exclude a particular step, or a step-alias from the set of build-steps that should be run. To use such an anti-step, just prefix any of the available build-steps with the "~" symbol.

Build everything but do not optimize and do not run J2V8 unit tests:<br/>
`build <...other-args> all ~j2v8optimize ~test`

Build only the Java parts and also run tests:<br/>
`build <...other-args> all ~native`

#### Step-Arguments

For some of the build-steps, you can pass additional command-line parameters that will be added as arguments when the CLI build-tool of this particular build-step is run.

Run the `j2v8test` step with additional args that will be passed to maven:<br/>
(e.g. run only the `LibraryLoaderTest`)<br/>
`build -t linux -a x64 --j2v8test="-Dtest=LibraryLoaderTest"`



# Build-Steps

The J2V8 build-system performs several build steps in a fixed order to produce the final J2V8 packages for usage on the designated target platforms. What follows is a short summary for what each of the executed build-steps does and what output artifacts are produced by each step.

```
Node.js --> CMake --> JNI --> C++ --> Optimize --> Java/Android Build --> Java/Android Test
```

# Cross-Compiling

For cross-compiling J2V8 uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (android, linux, windows) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (macos, windows).
The full source-code (of both J2V8 and Node.js) on the build-host are just shared via mounted volumes with the Docker / Vagrant machines, so you can quickly make changes and perform builds fast.

To invoke a cross-compile build, simply invoke the `build.py` script as usual but add the `--docker`, `-dkr` or `--vagrant`, `-vgr` flags.
This will automatically provision and run the necessary virtualization to run the requested build fully independent of your local environment.

<b>Note:</b> using Docker / Vagrant for cross-compilation requires many gigabytes of hard-drive space as well as downloading the required images & tools.
